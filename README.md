# @artsy/update-repo

Update github repos with a pull request

## Installation

    yarn add @artsy/update-repo

## Usage

Aside from node, you need two things in your execution environment to make this work:

- A [`GH_TOKEN` environment variable](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) which has permissions to create a PR to the repo you want to update.
- A git installation with `user.email` and `user.name` configured [or the equivalent environment variables](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables)

```ts
import { updateRepo } from "@artsy/update-repo"

await updateRepo({
  repo: { owner: "artsy", repo: "metaphysics" },
  branch: "update-npm-dependency",
  targetBranch: "master",
  title: "Update the version for my-npm-package",
  body: "bleep bloop :robot:",
  commitMessage: "update version",
  assignees: ["ds300"],
  labels: ["automated"],
  update: (dir) => {
    // This update function gets executed in a freshly-checked-out version
    // of the repo you specified. If you make any changes here they will
    // be committed and added to a PR.
    execSync(`yarn add my-npm-package@${newVersion}`, { cwd: dir })
  },
})
```
